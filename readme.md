Marketing Blurb: "Uses the employment prediction data from the UKCES LMI API, endpoint /wf/, as well as /soc/ and other sources. Allows a user to visually represent the future job trends, as well as (currently limited) statistical analysis.

Initially planned as a tool to automatically identify anomalies/issues in the pattern of future job progressions, but the data returned by LMI turned out to be too regular for this to work effectively. The historical data, however, is very interesting, but unfortunately not in line with the aim of the hack day. "
